# Steganography
Some tools i have developped to hide files of any type in images.
# lsb Steganography
(least significant bit )
is a well know method of steganography to hide date inside an carier image.

# Cover Generation:
does not require a carier image as it generates an image depending on the 
given file.
it is significantly faster than the lsb method so it might be better for lager
files.
The image generated here will be random hence clearly suspicious.
